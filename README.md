## Project:

The application is based on a simple representation of how a simple banking application works with its workflow and user interaction.
At the same time, it provides different methods of used functions that perform their own tasks in interaction with other functions.
This project allowed me to learn certain parts of C programming where I had a little difficulty.

application user to log in and log out at the same time. In addition, the application allows him to have insight into his account balance, 
as well as the possibility to request a new card for a new account, as well as the possibility of money transfer and bill payment.
